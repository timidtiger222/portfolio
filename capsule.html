  <h5>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h5>
  <p>For this project, I worked in a group with 3 other students to design an interactive interface for an emerging startup. 
    Our team went through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept. 
    This project is split into four parts to exemplify an iterative design process flow: 
    (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2) creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, 
    (3) conducting user testing on a final, revised prototype, and (4) contacting the start up. </p>

      <h2>Part 1 : Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      
      <h5>PRE-DESIGN THINKING</h5>
      <p>The startup that we chose to design a prototype for is called <u> CAPSULE</u>. 
      The idea behind this start up is to upload or take a photo of an item to a platform, 
      then receive links to purchase this item.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thought the best interface for this goal would be to design a mobile app because
        phones normally have cameras which would make it easy to take a photo, and they have photo
        albums where the users can chose a photo to upload.
      </p>
      <p>
        The users that would be impacted by our interface would be the normal everyday consumers
        because this service is targeted to people who want to buy certain items. Thus,
        this app would cater to users who want to purchase an item that they have seen before.
      </p>
 
      <h5>SKETCHING</h5>
      <p>Our group first individually brainstormed 4 possible designs for our startup's app. We each sketched out the 3
        main screens--home, find item, and results--on pen and paper.
      </p>

      </div>
      
      <h5>COMBINING IDEAS INTO WIREFRAME</h5>
      <p>After our discussion, we combined the sketches through the following design choices:
        <ul>
          <li>
            For the home page we decided to make the home screen not a login screen which 
            a user may encounter when they first get the app. Instead we decided to make the 
            home page that the user would expect to see if they had used the app before.
          </li>
          <li>
            The designs for the upload screen and the results screen were relatively similar
            across all the sketches so we refined those sketches to make them more cohesive.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Part 2 : Mockups</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      
      <h5>INTERACTIVE HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUP V1</h5>
      <p>This is the first version of our mockup.</p>
      <div class="banner-image">

      <h5>MOCKUP CRIT</h5>
      <p>We received the following feedback from the mockup critique:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the home page, the "FIND ITEM" verbiage was not conducive
          to what the button was trying to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow for accessibility to take/upload a picture no 
          matter where they are in the app (like TikTok's plus 
          button at the bottom bar)
        </li>
        <li>
          The icons on the navbar should
          change color when the user is actively on that page. For example, the home page icon would be a different
          color when the users are on the home page of the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          The save button is slightly too small to easily press on it in the mobile screen.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>INTERACTIVE HIGH FIDELITY MOCKUP V2</h5>
      <p>This is the second iteration of our mockup based on the feedback we recieved.</p>
